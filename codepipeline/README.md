# Code Pipeline

This Terraform template creates a complete CICD platform from scratch in a reproducible manner.  

### CodePipeline
Pipeline brings the following tools together into one cohesive toolchain, in the same vein as Spinnaker.

### CodeCommit
CodeCommit is similar to Git(Hub|Lab).

### CodeBuild
Similar to Jenkins.  Has a Jenkins plugin to create build slaves on demand.  

### CodeDeploy
Self explanitory.  Used to build the code.
